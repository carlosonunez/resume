All the Azure, all the time!

5/2017-6/2020
: **Contino**, _Technical Principal_
: Dallas, TX (and other locations)

At Contino, I focused on building high-performance, cross-functional teams to help large enterprises
get to production more quickly and providing high-quality technical solutions to tough problems.
Key elements of my approach were strategic and tactical advisory to senior engineering leadership,
providing engineers with technical leadership through mentorship, pairing, and coaching, and
showing the "art of the possible" through demos, example applications, and technical workshops.
Additionally, I provided thought leadership in infrastructure automation, modern software
development practices, DevOps, and SRE through blog posts, articles, talks, and workshops.

* **Global Financial Services Provider**: Decreased build and deploys for a popular backoffice
banking application by 87% and over $200k per release through building and leading a
cross-functional and product-aligned engineering team.
* **Global Consumer and Investment Bank**: Reduced team toil by over 50% and increased customer
attrition by over 40% for a global internal PaaS offering by building an embedded SRE team. 
* **Large Brokerage and Institutional Investor**: Adapted Ruby, Rspec, Cucumber and Selenium Grid
to reduce deployment time of a major investment portfolio management web service to 10 minutes
from 22 weeks.
* **Large Human Capital Management Provider**: Architected a portable monitoring-as-code platform
using Python, Bash and Datadog APIs.
* **Business Development**: Authored and participated in pre-sales and business development through
proposal writing and statement-of-work creation.
* **Community Outreach**: Authored several blog posts and talks for DevOpsDays, All Day DevOps,
and others.

5/2016-5/2017
: **ThoughtWorks**, Senior Infrastructure Consultant
: _Dallas, TX (and other locations)_

At ThoughtWorks, I was responsible for providing high-quality engineering for large enterprises. My
focus was largely on infrastructure automation and systems software development against legacy,
on-premise environments.

* **Global credit card issues and credit broker**: Architected infrastructure-as-code pattern for
  website deployments using Terraform and Chef.
* **Large national mortgage underwriting agency**: Delivered self-service environment creation
  pipeline using Puppet, Ruby and vRealize Operations that reduced creation of development
  environments by two weeks.
* **Large statewide dental insurance provider**: Architected a containerized platform for a dental
  claims processing engine with Rancher, Kubernetes, Docker and VMware vSphere.
* Created hiring and recruiting standards for infrastructure and DevOps consultants for ThoughtWorks
  nationwide.

10/15-5/16
: **Namely**, Site Reliability Engineer
: _New York, NY_

* Maintained 99% uptime and improved continuous deployment of Namely Payroll using Ansible, Octopus
  Deploy, Bash, PowerShell and Jenkins.
* Architected an Ansible playbook and Powershell/CloudFormation to migrate Namely's DMZ Active
  Directory domain onto AWS EC2 and, afterwards, to Amazon Enterprise AD.
* Architected a secure bastion host infrastructure for third-party benefit provider access into
  Namely Payroll with Powershell, Ansible and read-only domain controllers.

2/15-10/15
: **Google**, Managed Systems SRE
: _New York, NY_

* Architected, developed and deployed an outage reporting dashboard using Drupal, SQL and Google's
  visualization API that reduced our overdue backlog by over 60%.
* Hardened remote access and arbitrary command execution into our platform by developing a
  Kerberized Powershell endpoint for use with Rundeck, our infrastructure orchestration tool.
* Reduced knowledge silos and improved visibility of our tools throughout Corporate Engineering by
  creating documentation standards and writing several playbooks and runbooks.
* Consulted and vetted vendor designs for integrating enterprise-level third-party software onto
  Google infrastructure using Google best practices.
